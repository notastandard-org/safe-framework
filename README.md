# SAFE-T Framework (DRAFT)

**SAFE-T** is an open-source framework designed to identify, document, and disrupt the technological tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in abuse, coercive control, and extremism.

It draws inspiration from MITRE ATT&CK, MITRE DEFEND, and DISARM frameworks and introduces a lifecycle model based on real-world abuse patterns, tailored for investigators, researchers, developers, law enforcement, and survivor advocates.

---

## üåê Framework Purpose

SAFE-T supports:

- Identification of abuser behaviour across the tech-facilitated abuse lifecycle
- Mapping observable techniques to higher-order tactics
- Development of mitigations, detections, and countermeasures
- Survivor-informed interventions grounded in intelligence and cyber methodologies
- Standardisation of terms, labels, and lifecycle stages across domains

---

## üîÑ Abuse Lifecycle Stages

The SAFE-T framework is structured around 7 core lifecycle stages:

1. **Formation** ‚Äì Building access and grooming
2. **Discovery** ‚Äì Surveillance and probing
3. **Conditioning** ‚Äì Psychological manipulation via technology
4. **Control** ‚Äì Technological dominance and enforcement
5. **Execution** ‚Äì Acts of digital harm or coercion
6. **Exploitation** ‚Äì Sustained access, misuse, or weaponisation
7. **Recidivism** ‚Äì Patterns of reoffending and re-infiltration

Each stage contains **Tactics** (what the abuser wants to achieve) and **Techniques** (how they do it).
