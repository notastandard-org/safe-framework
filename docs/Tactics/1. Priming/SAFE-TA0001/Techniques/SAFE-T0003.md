# SAFE-T0003 - Desensitisation to Harm

## Summary

Through repeated exposure to abusive dynamics, often witnessed in others or online, individuals become emotionally desensitized to harm, reducing cognitive dissonance when initiating abusive actions themselves.

## Purpose

To bypass internal resistance to causing harm by minimizing empathy or increasing rationalization of violent behavior.

## Sub-techniques

* SAFE-T0003.001 - Online Exposure to Abuse Media
* SAFE-T0003.002 - Community Reinforcement (e.g. group chats that joke about violence)

## Procedure Examples

* Teen participates in Discord groups that ridicule abuse victims.
* Exposure to violent pornography lowers emotional inhibition toward coercive sex.

## Mitigation / Intervention

* Monitoring and parental control of online communities.
* Promotion of empathy and emotional regulation skills in youth education.
* De-platforming of normalized abuse communities.

## Detection

* Platform metadata analysis and AI-driven content engagement auditing.
* Sudden shifts in emotional affect or detachment.
* Peer or educational staff reporting concerning normalization.
