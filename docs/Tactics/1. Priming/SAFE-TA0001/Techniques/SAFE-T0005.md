# SAFE-T0005 - Observation of Role-Reversed Abuse

## Summary

An individual internalizes abusive traits by identifying with the abuser in scenarios where victims are powerless, reinforcing dominance as a form of control.

## Purpose

To foster identity formation around power dynamics, especially in environments where vulnerability is punished.

## Sub-techniques
* Victim-to-abuser cycle
* Power mimicry in relationships

## Procedure Examples

* "A child bullied at school begins to control their younger sibling."
* "A trauma survivor later adopts manipulative tactics as self-defense."

## Mitigation / Intervention

* Trauma therapy focused on identity repair
* Restorative justice practices

## Detection

* Narrative patterns during psychological evaluation
* Behavior mimicry in domestic or institutional settings
