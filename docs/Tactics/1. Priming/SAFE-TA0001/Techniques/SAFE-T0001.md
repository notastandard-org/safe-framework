# SAFE-T0001 - Exposure to Normative Abuse

## Summary

Exposure to abusive behaviours in familial, cultural, or media environments, which normalise or trivialise coercion, dominance, or emotional manipulation. These behaviors become internalised and accepted as baseline models of interaction.

## Purpose

This technique conditions the future abuser by embedding maladaptive beliefs about power, control, and interpersonal norms through routine exposure.

## Sub-techniques

* SAFE-T0001.001 - Familial Modelling
* SAFE-T0001.002 - Media Reinforcement
* SAFE-T0001.003 - Cultural/Religious Indoctrination

## Procedure Examples

* A child witnesses one parent emotionally manipulating the other regularly, which later informs their relationship behaviour.
* A teenager repeatedly views films where male dominance is rewarded and normalised.
* Religious teachings reinforce the idea of gendered power hierarchies and obedience.

## Mitigation / Intervention

* Early intervention programs focusing on healthy relationships.
* Media literacy education.
* Trauma-informed education and psychological counselling.

## Detection

* Self-reported upbringing in high-control or abusive environments.
* Professional assessment during intervention or court-ordered evaluations.
* Evidence of strong alignment with authoritarian norms or justification of abuse.
