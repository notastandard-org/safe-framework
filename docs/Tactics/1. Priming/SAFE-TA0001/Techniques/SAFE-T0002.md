# SAFE-T0002 - Trauma Reenactment Conditioning

## Summary

An abuser develops behavioural scripts based on unresolved childhood trauma, later reenacting similar dynamics in adult relationships as a form of unconscious mastery or repetition.

## Purpose

To recreate scenarios where the abuser can invert roles and gain control, safety, or validation by inflicting what they once experienced.

## Sub-techniques

* SAFE-T0002.001 - Role Inversion
* SAFE-T0002.002 - Self-Justification via Victimhood

## Procedure Examples

* A survivor of parental neglect becomes hyper-controlling to ensure their partner never leaves.
* An individual abused in childhood justifies their actions with statements like “It’s what I was taught.”

## Mitigation / Intervention

* Psychotherapeutic treatment addressing origin trauma.
* Community awareness of trauma cycles.
* Specialized abuse prevention programs targeting intergenerational transmission.

## Detection

* Therapeutic discovery through counseling.
* Pattern analysis across multiple relationships.
* Law enforcement identification of repeat generational abuse in families.
