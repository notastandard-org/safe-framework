# SAFE-TA0001: Formation

## Summary
Formation is the foundational stage where preconditions for abusive behaviour are cultivated. It involves the early development of attitudes, beliefs, and capabilities that may later be weaponised in abusive relationships. These conditions may emerge through childhood experiences, social modelling, intergenerational trauma, or the normalisation of harmful behaviours within families, peer groups, or media environments.

## Objective
To embed early behavioural, psychological, or cultural foundations that predispose the individual toward control, manipulation, or harmful relational dynamics.

## Characteristics
- Contexts observed: Domestic violence, coercive control, cultic systems, online radicalisation, toxic masculinity, patriarchal structures
- Abuser capabilities required: None initially, though social modelling and learned manipulation may occur over time

## References
- Attachment theory (Bowlby)
- Social learning theory (Bandura)
- Intergenerational transmission of trauma (Yehuda)
- Gender role socialisation research
- Case studies on abuser origin stories in domestic violence reports
