# SAFE-TA0009 - Recidivism

## Summary
Recidivism is the cyclical re-entry into abusive dynamics, either with the same or new targets. It reflects an abuser's pattern of repeated behaviours over time, often reinforced by impunity or unaddressed pathology.

## Objective

## Characteristics
- Category: Perpetuation
- Contexts observed: Serial abusers, community infiltration, repeated grooming cycles
- Abuser capabilities required: Grooming, gaslighting, compartmentalisation, denial of accountability

## References
