## Summary
Propagation refers to the transmission or reinforcement of abusive patterns across networks, families, or generations. This includes normalising behaviours, recruiting allies, and shaping environments that enable the abuse to persist or expand.

## Characteristics

- Contexts observed: Intergenerational abuse, cultic recruitment, mobbing, ideological grooming
- Abuser capabilities required: Indoctrination, manipulation, cultural embedding, influence

## References
