# SAFE-TA0011 - Disengagement

## Summary
Disengagement occurs when the abuser begins to withdraw from the active abuse cycle, either strategically or due to external factors. This may be accompanied by manipulation to preserve power post-separation or maintain latent control.

## Objective
To reduce effort or visibility while retaining some form of dominance or residual impact on the victimâ€™s life.

## Characteristics
- Category: Collapse
- Contexts observed: Relationship breakdown, post-separation abuse, cult collapse
- Abuser capabilities required: Strategic silence, passive control, exit manipulation

## References
- Separation abuse frameworks
- Legal disengagement with hidden control
- Coercive closure behaviours
